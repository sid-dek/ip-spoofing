This requires python along with scapy library.
Log into your Ubuntu machine.
On the terminal, navigate to the folder where ipspoof.py file is located.
Then,

1. sudo apt-get install python
	This will install python

2. sudo apt-get install python-pip
	This will install pip installer

3. sudo pip install scapy
	This will install python scapy library

4. sudo apt-get install wireshark
	To install wireshark (to see the spoofed IP packet details)

5. sudo wireshark
	To open wireshark (apply ip.addr="<source/destination-ip>" filter)

6. python ipspoof.py <source-ip-address> <destination-ip-address> "<Sample-payload-message>"
	This will tun the script

7. Wireshark will show the ip packet with spoofed source ip.

Cheers ^.^
